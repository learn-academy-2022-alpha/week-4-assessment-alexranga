# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer:
  Props (properties) are only passed in one direction, from parent to child.

  Researched answer:
  Props (properties) is a keyword in React for passing information from one component to another. Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters - properties.


2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer:
  DOM (Document Object Model), is an essential part of making websites interactive. 

  Researched answer:
  Almost any time a website performs an action, such as clicking, rotating between a slideshow of images, displaying an error when a user attempts to submit an incomplete form, or toggling a navigation menu, it is the result of JavaScript accessing and manipulating the DOM, which is DOM event(s).


3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: 
  Object-oriented programming is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

  Researched answer:
  Object-oriented programming refers to languages that uses objects in programming and aims to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function. 
  Functional programming includes languages such as Erlang and Scala, which are used for telecommunications and fault tolerant systems.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: 
  Ruby will consider any number written without decimals as an "Integer" and "Float" with numbers without decimals.

  Researched answer:
  Integers are a subset of the real numbers and are written without a fraction or a decimal component.
  A float in a Ruby program is a number that contains a decimal point.


5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: 
  Ruby’s methods will return the result of the last evaluated expression without the keyword return.

  Researched answer:
  In Ruby, the value of the last line of a method is automatically returned without using the keyword return.

1. Instance Variable: is a variable that is accessible in any instance method in a particular instance of a class

2. PostgreSQL: Postgres, is one type of SQL. Postgres is an open source object-relational database management system, which means Postgres looks at databases through an object-oriented programming (OOP) lens.

SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used for communicating with relational databases.

3. Ruby on Rails: is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby. 

Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages.

4. ORM: (Object-relational mapping) is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible systems using object-oriented programming languages. ORM is a tool that allows developers to write SQL queries using Rails.

5. Active Record: is a Rails ORM. Active Record takes data which is stored in a database table and lets you interact with the data like a Ruby object.
